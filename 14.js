The people of Sharper Insight have over 30 years of experience modeling social behavior and are authorities on applying classic and contemporary social theories from economics, political science, psychology, anthropology and sociology to building computational, analytical, or empirical models to understand and anticipate human responses. Experts in advanced social science methodologies for collecting and analyzing data, Sharper Insightâ€™s focus is on transforming available qualitative and quantitative data into computable constructs that can objectively represent what are often intangible theoretical social concepts. A deep knowledge of the history of social science, which includes an appreciation of both the successes and failures of previous work on measuring and finding relationships among social factors, is what differentiates Sharper Insight from other social science modeling teams. We are not modelers applying our skills to social questions; we are social scientists who utilize models to take the current understanding of the social world a step further."),n.a.createElement("p",null,n.a.createElement("span",{className:"bold"},"Model Specification"),n.a.createElement("br",null),"Converting a complex social question into a tractable social model requires formalizing the relationships among all significant elements. This, in turn, requires being able to distinguish important components from incidental noise. Social theories facilitate this process by serving as templates for framing specific situations of interest. Identifying the appropriate frame ensures the inclusion of key elements into the model."),n.a.createElement("p",null,n.a.createElement("span",{className:"bold"},"Data Collection"),n.a.createElement("br",null),"Social science data comes in many forms: census, archives, existing databases, surveys, newspaper articles, diaries, and reports, to name a few. Sharper Insight has experience mining these sources for information, and transforming this information into useful and interpretable measures of social constructs. In addition, when the collection of new data is feasible, our expertise in the design and implementation of surveys and real world experiments enables the collection of this data with high internal validity, providing added confidence that the information collected represents the concepts they were designed to measure."),n.a.createElement("p",null,n.a.createElement("span",{className:"bold"},"Measurement"),n.a.createElement("br",null),"Measuring social factors is not simply a matter of finding reasonable proxy variables in existing data. Manifest variables that appear to be reasonable indicators of an important social factor often fail to measure properly the concept of interest. This is because, for social phenomena, there is not often a one-to-one relationship between information gathered and social constructs. Often, the same bit of information is a partial indicator of many factors. Moreover, most important social factors can only be represented by combining several observable variables. Sharper Insight integrates social theory and advanced statistical tools, including latent variable analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, to ensure the proper specification of latent measures constructed from the available information. Our techniques measure the degree to which the data represents theoretical concepts and fit theoretical models to enable the construction of meaningful scales and indices that formalize, quantify, and parameterize qualitative ideas for use in statistical, computational or analytical models."),n.a.createElement("p",null,n.a.createElement("span",{className:"bold"},"Interpretation"),n.a.createElement("br",null),"Interpreting the outcomes of social science models is not straightforward. Some social science findings are limited to situations with specific conditions, and most models of social phenomena are built and thereby limited by assumptions about pre-conditions or behavioral options. Grounding interpretation in social theory makes explicit scope conditions and underlying model assumptions and inhibits the temptation to overgeneralize findings that can lead to misunderstandings or the improper application of the model findings.")))}},398:function(e,a){}});
